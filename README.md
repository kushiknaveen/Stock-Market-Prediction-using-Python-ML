<h2>Introduction </h2>
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. 
With the abundance of financial data available, employing advanced algorithms can provide insights into potential future movements in stock prices. 
The project focuses on developing models that can forecast stock prices accurately, thereby assisting investors and traders in making informed decisions.

<h3>Data Collection</h3>

Utilizes Yahoo Finance as the Data source. Can also ise Alpha Vantage, or APIs like Quandl to gather historical stock data.
Incorporates fundamental data such as Opening, Closing, High, Low prices

<h3>Pre-Proecissing</h3>
Cleansing and preparing the collected data for analysis.
Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization for improved model performance.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
Investigates relationships and patterns within the data.
Visualizes stock price trends, volume, and other relevant factors.

<h3>Model Development</h3>
Implements machine learning algorithm Random Forest. Can use Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).
We can also Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and accuracy.

<h3> Future Enhancements</h3>
Incorporating deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformer models for improved prediction accuracy.
Implementing reinforcement learning techniques for dynamic trading strategies.
Developing a user-friendly interface for visualization and interaction with the prediction models.
Integration with cloud services for scalability and efficient data processing.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices accurately, facilitating better decision-making for investors and traders. 
By incorporating diverse data sources and advanced algorithms, the project strives to enhance prediction capabilities and contribute to the field of financial forecasting. 
Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcomed to further improve the project's effectiveness and usability.
